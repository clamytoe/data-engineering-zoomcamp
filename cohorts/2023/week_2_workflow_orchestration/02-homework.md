# Week 2 Homework

The goal of this homework is to familiarise users with workflow orchestration and observation.

## Question 1. Load January 2020 data

Using the `etl_web_to_gcs.py` flow that loads taxi data into GCS as a guide, create a flow that loads the green taxi CSV dataset for January 2020 into GCS and run it. Look at the logs to find out how many rows the dataset has.

```

How many rows does that dataset have?

* [X] **447,770**
* [ ] 766,792
* [ ] 299,234
* [ ] 822,132

## Question 2. Scheduling with Cron

Cron is a common scheduling specification for workflows.

Using the flow in `etl_web_to_gcs.py`, create a deployment to run on the first of every month at 5am UTC. Whatâ€™s the cron schedule for that?

```bash
prefect deployment build etl_web_to_gcs_hw.py:etl_web_to_gcs -n monthly_etl --cron "0 5 1 * *
" -a
Found flow 'etl-web-to-gcs'
Default '.prefectignore' file written to

warning.
Deployment 'etl-web-to-gcs/monthly_etl' successfully created with id 'e411636d-2e1a-471a-8ed7-6136455106e8'.

To execute flow runs from this deployment, start an agent that pulls work from the 'default' work queue:
$ prefect agent start -q 'default'
```

* [X] **`0 5 1 * *`**
* [ ] `0 0 5 1 *`
* [ ] `5 * 1 0 *`
* [ ] `* * 5 1 0`

## Question 3. Loading data to BigQuery

Using `etl_gcs_to_bq.py` as a starting point, modify the script for extracting data from GCS and loading it into BigQuery. This new script should not fill or remove rows with missing values. (The script is really just doing the E and L parts of ETL).

The main flow should print the total number of rows processed by the script. Set the flow decorator to log the print statement.

Parametrize the entrypoint flow to accept a list of months, a year, and a taxi color.

Make any other necessary changes to the code for it to function as required.

```python
from pathlib import Path

import pandas as pd
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect_gcp import GcpCredentials
from prefect_gcp.cloud_storage import GcsBucket


@task(retries=3)
def extract_from_gcs(color: str, year: int, month: int) -> Path:
    """Download trip data from GCS"""
    gcs_path = f"data/{color}/{color}_tripdata_{year}-{month:02}.parquet"
    gcs_block = GcsBucket.load("zoom-gcs")
    gcs_block.get_directory(from_path=gcs_path, local_path=f"../data/")  # type: ignore
    return Path(f"../data/{gcs_path}")


@task()
def write_bq(df: pd.DataFrame) -> None:
    """Write DataFrame to BiqQuery"""

    gcp_credentials_block = GcpCredentials.load("zoom-gcp-creds")

    df.to_gbq(
        destination_table="dezoomcamp.rides",
        project_id="prefect-sbx-community-eng",
        credentials=gcp_credentials_block.get_credentials_from_service_account(),  # type:ignore
        chunksize=500_000,
        if_exists="append",
    )


@flow(log_prints=True)
def etl_gcs_to_bq(months: list[int], year: int, color: str) -> None:
    """Main ETL flow to load data into Big Query"""
    total_rows = 0
    for month in months:
        path = extract_from_gcs(color, year, month)
        df = pd.read_parquet(path)
        total_rows += df.shape[0]
        write_bq(df)
    print(f"Total number of rows processed: {total_rows}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    months = [2, 3]
    color = "yellow"
    year = 2019
    etl_gcs_to_bq(months, year, color)
```

Create a deployment for this flow to run in a local subprocess with local flow code storage (the defaults).

```bash
prefect deployment build ./etl_gcs_to_bq_hw.py:etl_gcs_to_bq -n "GCS to BQ Parameterized"
Found flow 'etl-gcs-to-bq'
Deployment YAML created at

warning.
```

*parameters:*

```yaml

```

```bash
prefect deployment apply etl_gcs_to_bq-deployment.yaml

Make sure you have the parquet data files for Yellow taxi data for Feb. 2019 and March 2019 loaded in GCS.

Run your deployment to append this data to your BiqQuery table. How many rows did your flow code process?

## Question 4. Github Storage Block

Using the `web_to_gcs` script from the videos as a guide, you want to store your flow code in a GitHub repository for collaboration with your team. Prefect can look in the GitHub repo to find your flow code and read it. Create a GitHub storage block from the UI or in Python code and use that in your Deployment instead of storing your flow code locally or baking your flow code into a Docker image.

![gh-block](gh-block.png)

Note that you will have to push your code to GitHub, Prefect will not push it for you.

Run your deployment in a local subprocess (the default if you donâ€™t specify an infrastructure). Use the Green taxi data for the month of November 2020.

```bash
prefect deployment build week_2_workflow_orchestration/demo/flows/02_gcp/gh_flows/etl_web_to_gh_hw.py:etl_web_to_gcs --name git_flow -sb github/clamytoe-dez -a

## Question 5. Email or Slack notifications

Q5. Itâ€™s often helpful to be notified when something with your dataflow doesnâ€™t work as planned. Choose one of the options below for creating email or slack notifications.

The hosted Prefect Cloud lets you avoid running your own server and has Automations that allow you to get notifications when certain events occur or donâ€™t occur.

Create a free forever Prefect Cloud account at app.prefect.cloud and connect your workspace to it following the steps in the UI when you sign up.

Set up an Automation that will send yourself an email when a flow run completes.

Run the deployment used in Q4 for the Green taxi data for April 2019. Check your email to see the notification.

Alternatively, use a Prefect Cloud Automation or a self-hosted Orion server Notification to get notifications in a Slack workspace via an incoming webhook.

Join my temporary Slack workspace with [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/temp-notify/shared_invite/zt-1odklt4wh-hH~b89HN8MjMrPGEaOlxIw). 400 people can use this link and it expires in 90 days.

In the Prefect Cloud UI create an [Automation](https://docs.prefect.io/ui/automations) or in the Prefect Orion UI create a [Notification](https://docs.prefect.io/ui/notifications/) to send a Slack message when a flow run enters a Completed state. Here is the Webhook URL to use: <https://hooks.slack.com/services/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>

# Terraform

## Authenticate

```bash
(base) ➜  terraform git:(clamytoe) ✗ gcloud auth application-default login

The environment variable [GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS] is set to:
  [/home/clamytoe/.ssh/dtc-de-course-374214-d1c03526690c.json]
Credentials will still be generated to the default location:
  [/home/clamytoe/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json]
To use these credentials, unset this environment variable before
running your application.

Credentials saved to file: [/home/clamytoe/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json]

These credentials will be used by any library that requests Application Default Credentials (ADC).

Quota project "dtc-de-course-374214" was added to ADC which can be used by Google client libraries for billing and quota. Note that some services may still bill the project owning the resource.

## Terraform Initialization

```bash
(base) ➜  terraform git:(clamytoe) ✗ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "local"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/google...
- Installing hashicorp/google v4.48.0...
- Installed hashicorp/google v4.48.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

## Terraform Plan

```bash
(base) ➜  terraform git:(clamytoe) ✗ terraform plan -var="project=dtc-de-course-374214"

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated
with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_bigquery_dataset.dataset will be created

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions
if you run "terraform apply" now.
